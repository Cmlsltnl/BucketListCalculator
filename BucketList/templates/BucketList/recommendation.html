<h1>{{user.user}}'s Recommendations</h1>

<p>Great job on making your Bucket List!  Now it's time for the real fun: Statistics and Recommendations!  Yay.  Let's get down to business.</p>
<br/>

<p>Total Cost: {{total_cost}}</p>
<p>Total Hours: {{total_hours}}</p>
<p>Total Days: {{total_time}}</p>
<p>Total Number of Items Left on List: {{total_number_of_items}}</p>
<p>Your age: {{age}}</p>
<p>Your Life Expectancy: {{life_expectancy}}</p>
<p>Your Yearly Earnings: {{yearly_earnings}}</p>
<p>Your Hourly Wage: {{hourly_wage}}</p>
<p>Your Average Hours Per Week: {{work_hours_per_week}}</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>If you live to age {{life_expectancy}} then you need to accomplish  about {{accomplish_per_year}} goals each year for the rest of your life.  In other words you need to accomplish a goal about every {{days_per_goal}} days.
<br>
<br>
 In order to accomplish everything that you want you will need to dedicate about ${{cost_per_year}} per year.  This is the equivalent of {{percent_of_yearly_wage}}% of your yearly income.  
 <br>
 <br>
 The cost of the average goal on your bucket list is {{cost_of_average_goal}}.
 <br>
 <br>
 If you do live for {{years_left}} more years then you need to spend about {{days_per_year}} full days every year doing things that will help you cross off Bucket List Goals. 
 <br>
 <br>
 Now along with those full days spend you also should allocate about {{hours_per_month}} hours every month to accomplishing these goals.  Or roughly {{hours_per_week}} hours every single week.
