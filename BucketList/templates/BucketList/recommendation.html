            <p>
                Great job on making your Bucket List!  Now it's time for the real fun: Statistics and Recommendations!  Yay.  Let's get down to business.
            </p>

            <!-------------Basic Overview-------------->
            <br>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In order to finish all of items left on your list by the age of {{life_expectancy|floatformat:"0"}} then you need to accomplish <span class = "number">{{accomplish_per_year|floatformat:"1"}} goals each year</span> until you are {{life_expectancy|floatformat:"0"}} years old.  In other words you need to accomplish a goal about every <span class = "number">{{days_per_goal|floatformat:"0"}} days</span>.
            <br>
            <br>
             In order to accomplish everything that you want you will need to dedicate about <span class = "number text-success">${{cost_per_year|floatformat:"2"|intcomma}}</span> per year.  This is the equivalent of <span class = "number orange">{{percent_of_yearly_wage|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of your current yearly income.  
             <br>
             <br>
             The cost of the average goal on your bucket list is <span class = "number text-success">${{cost_of_average_goal|floatformat:"2"|intcomma}}</span>.
             <br>
             <br>
             You have <span class = "number">{{years_left|floatformat:"0"}} more years</span> to accomplish all of your goals.  Which means you need to dedicate about <span class = "number">{{days_per_year|floatformat:"1"}} full days</span> every year doing things that will help you cross off Bucket List Goals. 
             <br>
             <br>
             Now along with those full days you also should allocate about <span class = "number">{{hours_per_month|floatformat:"1"}} hours</span> every month to accomplishing these goals.  Or roughly <span class = "number">{{hours_per_week|floatformat:"1"}} hours</span> every single week.
             <br>
             <br>
             But this is just general stuff.  Lets get more specific!

              <!------------Most Difficult Goal-------------->
             <br>
             <h2>Your Most Difficult Goal</h2>
             <br>
              <p>Not all goals take the same amount of effort.  For example according to the data you entered <i class = "number">{{most_difficult_goal}}</i> is your most difficult goal.  This goal is  <span class = "number">{{most_difficult_percentage_harder|floatformat:"1"}} times more difficult</span> than your average goal! That could be a rough one.  But we believe in you.
              <br>
              <br>
              Not only is this goal <span class = "number">{{most_difficult_percentage_harder|floatformat:"1"}} times harder</span> than your average goal but it makes up <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_goal_percentage|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of all of the time, money, and resources you need to put into accomplishing everything on your entire Bucket List.  If you want to finish your goals in exactly {{years_left|floatformat:"0"}} years (by the age of {{life_expectancy|floatformat:"0"}}) you could take <span class = "number">{{years_needed_for_most_difficult|floatformat:"0"}} years</span> to accomplish only this goal and still be on pace to accomplish everything else!
              <br>
              <br>
              How does <i class = "number">{{most_difficult_goal}}</i> stacks up against everyone else's goals?
              <br>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                  {% if most_difficult_percentage_of_average_cost > 10 %}
                    
                        It's a very expensive goal!  It's <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_percent_of_yearly|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of your annual income.  At <span class = "number text-success">${{most_difficult_bucket_list_item.cost|floatformat:"0"|intcomma}}</span> <i>{{most_difficult_goal}}</i> is more expensive than <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_more_cost_than|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of the goals on Bucket List Calculator.  Its even  <span class = "number">{{most_difficult_percentage_of_average_cost|floatformat:"1"}} times</span> more expensive than the average goal 
                        
                  {% elif most_difficult_percentage_of_average_cost > 3 %}
                        
                        This one sure going to cost you!  At <span class = "number">{{most_difficult_percentage_of_average_cost|floatformat:"1"}} times</span> larger than the average users goal, and <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_percent_of_yearly|floatformat:"1"}}% </span>of your annual income this is even more costly than <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_more_cost_than|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of all goals on all of Bucket List Calculator.
                        
                  {% elif most_difficult_percentage_of_average_cost > 0.6 %}
                                    
                         This is going to be quite the costly goal.  It's larger than <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_more_cost_than|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of all the goals on Bucket List Calculator.  It also equates to <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_percentage_of_average_cost|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of your annual income. 
                                      
                  {% else %}
                  
                        Your goal is more expensive than <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_more_cost_than|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of all the in progress goals on Bucket List Calculator.  It costs <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_percentage_of_average_cost|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of your annual income.    
                        
                  
                  {% endif %}

                  
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                  This will take more hours to accomplish than <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_more_hours_than|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of all the Bucket List  Goals on this website. 
                  
                  {% if most_difficult_percentage_of_average_hours > 1 %}
                  
                        You have projected that <i>{{most_difficult_goal}}</i>  will take {{most_difficult_bucket_list_item.hours}}  hours to accomplish,  or <span class = "number">{{most_difficult_percentage_of_average_hours|floatformat:"1"}} times</span> more hours than the average users goal.  
                        
                        {% if most_difficult_percentage_of_average_hours > 3 %}
                        
                            In order to put that into perspective a little bit better the average goal on this site would take about {{average_goal_average_hours_per_year|floatformat:"1"}} hours a week for an entire year to accomplish.  In your case it would take <span class = "number">{{most_difficult_average_hours_per_year|floatformat:"1"}} every week</span>.
                            
                            
                            {% if most_difficult_percentage_of_average_hours > 5 %}
                            
                            That's quite the goal!  Sounds like it will be a ton of work.  We bet it will be worth it though.
                            
                            {% endif %}

                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                  Your goal will take more full days dedicated to it than <span class = "number orange">{{most_difficult_more_days_than|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of all the goals on this website.
                  
                  {% if most_difficult_percentage_of_average_time > 2 %}
                  
                        Most users goals take around {{average_time_of_all_goals|floatformat:"0"}} full days.  Coming in at {{most_difficult_bucket_list_item.time|floatformat:"0"}} full days 
                        
                            {% if most_difficult_percentage_of_average_time > 4 %}
                                
                                    (<span class = "number">{{most_difficult_percentage_of_average_time|floatformat:"1"}} times</span> more days than the average goal) this goal is going to require some serious time set aside to accomplish!  Good luck.
                                    
                            {% else %}

             <br>
             <p>Unfortunately for most of us when it comes to our Bucket List goals money is the bottleneck.  We want to do it all, but doing it all can cost quite a bit.  That is where Bucket List Calculator comes in.  We can give you a better outline to accomplish using all of the information you have so graciously provided:

                            According to the of goals on your list and your current annual income it appears that in order to accomplish everything on your list it will put you underneath an average liveable wage for a single person.       
                        </li>

                <br>
                <li>
                    Your goals will cost you an average of <span class = "number text-success">${{cost_per_year|floatformat:"2"|intcomma}}</span> per year.  This is the equivalent of <span class = "number orange">{{percent_of_yearly_wage|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of your current yearly income.
                    
                    {% if 10 > percent_of_yearly_wage %}
                    
                        This is excellent!  At this percent of your yearly income everything on your Bucket List should be a breeze to pay for.  You could even go check out some of our other intriguing users goals and find some things to add to your own list.

                        This is a fairly large percentage of your yearly income.  In order to cross off everything on your Bucket List you will need some dedication to financial planning and be able to live well within your means to help save money for your goals.  With that said, congrats!  You have some mighty big dreams and that's pretty neat.

                        Well someone must have some awfully costly goals! We commend you on having lofty goals and envy how many awesome things you must have on your list.  Unfortunately unless there are some major unforeseen windfalls this is just too much money for you to handle based on what you have listed.

                        This might be a little bit intimidating for you after all <span class = "number text-success">${{cost_per_year|floatformat:"2"|intcomma}}</span> per year is a lot of money.  But it is important for you to see these numbers so you can make a better plan to accomplish everything.  We urge you not to remove any items from your list.  We don't want you to cross off any of your dreams!  Instead of removing items first look for other ways to improve your financial situation.

                    Currently your Bucket List will require about <span class= "number orange">{{percent_of_yearly_wage|floatformat:"1"}}%</span> of your annual income every year if you want to accomplish everything by the time you are <span class= "number">{{life_expectancy|floatformat:"0"}} years old</span>.  Now lets see how improving your annual income will improve the percent you have to spend every year to accomplish your goals.

                            The following example is adjusted for inflation and increases in price to the current market basket.  For the sake of readability we will not go into much more detail on economics topics here.  When looking at the information below just remember that they are given in today's dollars.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Inflation in the United States has averaged roughly <span class = "number orange">3%</span> over the last one hundred years.  So the tabs below represent increases of income <span class = "number">above and beyond</span> that <span class = "number orange">3%</span> average yearly increase.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For example if there is <span class = "number orange">3%</span> yearly inflation your income would need to increase your income by <span class = "number orange">4%</span> in order to see a <span class = "number orange">1%</span> gain in your adjusted annual income.

It is very optimistic but we bet that if you apply yourself and work hard until you are <span class = "number">{{adjusted_life_expectancy|floatformat:"0"}} years old</span> you could make it happen.  For many people this kind of increase in income would require a complete career change, extremely profitable investments, or a venture into entrepreneurship.
