BucketListCalculator

====================

A site that allows users to create/customize their own personal bucket list while networking and observing other users doing the same.  The site is centred around giving users time lines to reach their goals.  Using the information entered users will see how many goals they need to accomplish per year in order to cross off every item on the list and other useful data related to their goals.
